# Dark Mode Toggle Implementation

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Created ThemeToggle component in `frontend/src/components/ui/ThemeToggle.tsx`
- [x] Installed required dependencies: `next-themes` and `@radix-ui/react-icons`
- [x] Added theme toggle options to user menu in `frontend/src/components/auth/user-menu.tsx`
- [x] Wrapped the app with ThemeProvider in `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`
- [x] Verified that Tailwind CSS dark mode styles are already configured in `globals.css`
- [x] Fixed hydration mismatch by updating viewport colorScheme and adding suppressHydrationWarning

## Remaining Tasks
- [ ] Test the dark mode toggle functionality (requires running the development server)
- [ ] Verify that the theme persists across page reloads
- [ ] Ensure all components properly support dark mode
- [ ] Add visual indicators for the current theme in the user menu

## Notes
- The project uses Tailwind CSS with dark mode support already configured in `globals.css`
- ThemeProvider is configured with `attribute="class"` to toggle the `dark` class on the html element
- Default theme is set to "system" with system theme detection enabled
- The dark mode toggle is accessible through the user menu dropdown (avatar in top right)
- Hydration mismatch fixed by allowing both light and dark color schemes and suppressing warnings
